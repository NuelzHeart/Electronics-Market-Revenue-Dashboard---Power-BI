## 📖 Description
This project aims to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for a multinational electronics firm, enabling the analysis of revenue performance across sales representatives, regions, and product categories. It delivers clear insights by quarter and customer demographics to support informed, data-driven business decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### 1. Problem Definition
The analysis aims to answer key business questions such as:
- Which products and sales representatives generate the most revenue?
- Are there gender-based or age-based differences in sales performance?
- Which regions or stores perform best and which underperform?
- How does revenue vary across quarters and months?

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
To ensure accurate analysis, the following steps were performed:
- Merged first and last names into a single Full Name field
- Standardized and formatted date fields
- Converted revenue values into a consistent numeric format
- Created derived columns such as:
  - Age Group
  - Revenue per Sale
  - Product Category Summary
 
### 3. Data Analysis
Key analytical tasks included:
- Analyzed revenue performance across regions and stores  
- Evaluated quarterly and monthly sales trends  
- Compared revenue by product categories  
- Assessed sales performance by age group and gender  
- Analyzed revenue differences by store rank level

### 4. Dashboard Development
The dashboard was developed in Power BI to provide an interactive and intuitive view of revenue performance across time, regions, products, stores, and customer demographics. Key development features include:
- KPI cards displaying Total Revenue, Total Transactions, Average Customer Age, and Total Products
- Year slicers (2022–2024) to enable time-based filtering and comparison
- Bar charts illustrating revenue by Region, Product Category, and Store Rank
- Donut chart showing revenue distribution by Quarter
- Line chart visualizing Monthly Sales Trends
- Clustered bar chart analyzing revenue by Age Group and Gender
- Consistent layout, color theme, and icons to enhance readability and usability

## 📈 Guided Questions for Visualization
The dashboard is designed to answer:
- Which regions or stores generate the highest revenue?
- What are the best-selling product types?
- Are there noticeable gender or age trends in sales?
- Which quarters or months recorded peak sales?
- How does revenue change by quarter?
- How does performance differ by rank level or store ID?

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Power BI for Data Visualizations
- Excel Dataset
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- PowerPoint for dashboard wireframing

## 💡 Key Business Value

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators
| KPI | Value |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Total Revenue | 127.4M |
| Total Transaction | 3.264K |
| Total Product | 4 |
| Average Age | 34.24% |

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Asia is the top-performing region, contributing the majority of total revenue, while the U.S. generates the lowest revenue among the regions.
- Smartphones dominate product sales, accounting for the largest share of revenue compared to accessories, tablets, and laptops.
- QTR 1 generates the highest revenue, indicating a strong early-year sales performance, followed by a decline in later quarters.
- Monthly sales peak in November, suggesting seasonal demand, while mid-year months show noticeable revenue dips.
- Store 1 significantly outperforms other stores, while lower-ranked stores contribute minimal revenue.
- Mature and early-career adults drive the highest revenue, with male customers contributing more revenue than females across most age groups.
- The average customer age of ~34 years indicates that core buyers fall within the working-age demographic.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Increase investment in the Asian market through targeted promotions and expanded product availability to maximize its strong revenue performance.
- Focus marketing and inventory strategies on smartphones, as they are the primary revenue driver across all regions.
- Replicate QTR 1 sales strategies (campaigns, pricing, promotions) across weaker quarters to stabilize revenue throughout the year.
- Plan major promotions around peak months, especially November, while introducing incentives during low-performing months to reduce seasonality gaps.
- Analyze best practices from Store 1 and apply successful sales strategies to underperforming stores to improve overall performance.
- Tailor marketing campaigns to high-performing age groups, particularly mature and early-career adults, while designing gender-inclusive strategies to boost female customer engagement.
- Develop loyalty programs for working-age customers, aligning offers with their purchasing behavior to increase repeat sales and long-term revenue.

## ✅ Project Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of Power BI to convert raw sales data into clear, actionable business insights. By analyzing revenue performance across regions, product categories, time periods, and customer demographics, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales trends and key performance drivers.

The analysis reveals regional and product strengths, highlights seasonal sales patterns, and shows how demographic factors influence revenue outcomes. These insights provide a deeper understanding of business and help identify opportunities for performance improvement.

Overall, the project showcases core data analytics skills, including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight communication. It reflects a practical, business-oriented approach to analytics and serves as a strong example of an entry-level data analysis project.
